SOCKET CHAT
===========

A simple chat client.. using node and WebSockets!

####Technically...

it uses Socket.IO <http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO> and <http://github.com/LearnBoost/Socket.IO-node>,
which also provides Flash sockets, XHR polling and stuff.. 

But I allow it only `websocket`s to connect..

####Using this

Just download (clone) the repository and `$ node app.js`!
